Welcome to Evomi's Mobile Proxies repository! This project demonstrates how to use our high-quality mobile proxies in various programming languages.

## What are Mobile Proxies?
Mobile proxies are IP addresses that come from mobile devices and cellular networks. They offer a unique blend of anonymity and authenticity, as they appear to websites as real mobile users. This makes them ideal for tasks that require a genuine mobile user appearance.

## Getting Started
Before running any of the example scripts, you need to set up your credentials:

```bash
export proxy_username=your_username
export proxy_password=your_password
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the credentials provided by Evomi.

## Protocol
Please note, while these examples demonstrate the proxies with the http protocl, Evomi offers support for **HTTP HTTPS and SOCKS5**, aswell as SOCKS4 if required.


## Usage Examples
We provide example scripts in 6 different programming languages to help you get started quickly:

### cURL
```bash
curl -x mp.evomi.com:3000 -U "${proxy_username}:${proxy_password}" https://ip.evomi.com/s
```

### Python
```bash
python python_example_mp.py
```

### Node.js
```bash
node nodejs_example_mp.js
```

### PHP
```bash
php php_example_mp.php
```

### Go
```bash
go run go_example_mp.go
```

### Java
```bash
